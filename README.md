## LALIGA Dataset: Statistical Analysis
**Author: Victor Garcia Rubio**

This is the repository made by Victor Garcia Rubio containing the statistical analysis made on Laliga Dataset for Statistical Modelling subset of the Signal's Theory Master: Machine Learning track at UPM. 
I have analysed the most relevant statistics such as Fouls, Corners, Shoots, Goals, etc. in order to compare the different teams.
The complete project is described on the PDF report file.
